## 🎨 Customization

- **Update content:** Edit the text in each HTML file (`about.html`, `education.html`, `contact.html`) to reflect your latest details.
- **Navigation:** Ensure each page’s navbar links to the other pages for smooth navigation.
- **Branding:** Add your name/logo, a favicon, and consistent colors/typography in a shared CSS file (e.g., `styles/main.css`).
- **Projects section (optional):** Add a `projects.html` with cards linking to your GitHub repositories or live demos.
- **Media:** Place images in `assets/images/` and reference them with relative paths.

## ☁️ Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. **Commit your changes** to the `main` branch.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Choose **Branch: `main`** and **Folder: `/ (root)`**, then **Save**.
5. Your site will be available at:
   ```
   https://amisha30-3.github.io/My-portfolio/home.html
   ```

> You can make `home.html` your root by renaming it to `index.html` so the URL becomes simply `/`.

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Ideas
- Convert to a single‑page layout (`index.html`) with smooth scrolling.
- Add a **Projects** page with GitHub repo stats.
- Include a downloadable **Resume (PDF)**.
- Light/Dark theme toggle.
- Basic form handling for `contact.html` (e.g., using Formspree or Netlify Forms).
- SEO improvements: page titles, meta descriptions, and Open Graph tags.
- Accessibility pass (alt text, color contrast, semantic headings).
